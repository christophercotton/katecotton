    <richText>Okay, so I am testing out how well iweb will work as a blog.  Probably not going to be my first choice as I will have to have my desktop computer when I want to write.  But here it is and I want to see if it is possible (and easy) for people to leave comments.  So here are some topics in case you need one.&#xD;	1.	 This winter is the coldest on record.  What have you had to deal with as a result?&#xD;	2.	Do you like it when other people wear perfume or does it make you sick?&#xD;	3.	What is your favorite TV show right now?</richText>
